# Setting your expectations...

This project is a side-project of its main author. As such, it is in a constant state of flux. Expect frequent
breakages, huge refactorings, trials, errors and dead-ends.

At the time of writing, in April 2020, the project is barely started: the user can display the list of users and
parties. Otherwise, nothing else is implemented.
